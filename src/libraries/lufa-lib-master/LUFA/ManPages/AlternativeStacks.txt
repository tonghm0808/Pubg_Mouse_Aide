 *
 *  LUFA is not the only stack available for the USB AVRs, although it is perhaps the best (\see Page_WhyUseLUFA).
 *  In the interests of completeness and user choice, other known USB AVR stacks are listed here.
 *
 *  - Atmel USB AVR Stack (<i>Atmel Inc.</i>) \n
 *    <b>Cost:</b> Free \n
 *    <b>License:</b> Atmel Limited License (see Atmel download for details) \n
 *    <b>Website:</b> http://atmel.com/dyn/products/app_notes.asp?family_id=607#USB \n
 *    <b>Description:</b> This is the official Atmel USB AVR stack, for their 8-bit USB AVR lineup. Each series of
 *                        USB AVR is seperated into a seperate download stack, which is both AVR-GCC and IAR compatible.
 *
 *  - Dr. Stefan Salewski's AT90USB1287 Stack (<i>Dr. Stefan Salewski</i>) \n
 *    <b>Cost:</b> Free \n
 *    <b>License:</b> GPL \n
 *    <b>Website:</b> http://www.ssalewski.de/AT90USB_firmware.html.en \n
 *    <b>Description:</b> This is a GPL'd library specifically designed for the AT90USB1287, by Dr. Stefan Salewski, a
 *                        German Physicist. It compiles for AVR-GCC and can potentially be modified to work on other USB
 *                        AVR models.
 *
 *  - PJRC Teensy Stack (<i>Paul Stoffregen</i>) \n
 *    <b>Cost:</b> Free \n
 *    <b>License:</b> BSD \n
 *    <b>Website:</b> http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/usb_debug_only.html \n
 *    <b>Description:</b> Not so much a complete stack as a collection of USB enabled demos, this library is specifically
 *                        designed for the PJRC Teensy line of USB AVRs, and thus may need to be modified for other USB AVR
 *                        chips. These code samples shows the inner workings of the USB controller, without all the abstraction
 *                        present in most other USB AVR stacks.
