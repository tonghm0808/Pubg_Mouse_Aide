 *  \section Sec_Dependencies Module Source Dependencies
 *  The following files must be built with any user project that uses this module:
 *    - LUFA/Drivers/USB/Class/Device/RNDIS.c
 *    - LUFA/Drivers/USB/Class/Host/RNDIS.c
 *
 *  \section Module Description
 *  RNDIS Class Driver module. This module contains an internal implementation of the Microsoft USB RNDIS Networking
 *  Class, for both Device and Host USB modes. User applications can use this class driver instead of implementing the
 *  RNDIS class manually via the low-level LUFA APIs.
 *
 *  This module is designed to simplify the user code by exposing only the required interface needed to interface with
 *  Hosts using the USB RNDIS Class.
